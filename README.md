# TextRecommendationSystem

The two most common types of recommendation systems are: 1. Content based recommender systems 2. Colaborative Filtering recommender systems: Its a system in which the behaviour of a group of users is used to make recommendations to other users.

        There are 2 types of collaborative filtering recommender systems:
            1. Memory based
            2. Model based

                Memory based recommendation systems are easy to implement and simple to explain. They are divided into 2:
                    1. User-based Collaborative filtering: Recommendations based on likes of similar users.
                    2. Item-based collaborative filtering: Recommendations based on items same liked by different users.


                Model based recommendation systems are complex and use data science techniques like data mining, dimensionality reduction, decision trees, rule-based models, Bayesian methods. These are based on matrix factorisation and are better in dealing with sparsity.

        Content based recommendation systems works on recommending items similar to what the user has liked or shown interest in. It recommends items the user is most likely to like.
